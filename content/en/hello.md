# Introduction to Xingxi's Blog

###### Hi everyone, I'm Xingxi. The purpose of this blog is simple — to learn new things, record and reflect until I truly grasp them, and share what I’ve learned so others can join the journey. This post is to set the basic structure for my future articles so they don’t become messy or inconsistent.

## 1. Getting Acquainted

Most of what I’ll be sharing here comes from my own journey — from being a complete beginner to someone who may not be an expert but is no longer clueless. I’ll explain how I first got into each topic, why it drew my attention, and how you can decide if it’s something you want to dive into too.

## 2. Through the Thickets

Here I’ll talk about the dead ends I ran into, and more importantly, how I found my way out. I believe this is the part most people will find valuable. I’ll try my best to explain not just what worked, but **why** it worked — from either a logical or personal perspective.

## 3. Riding the Flow

In this part, I’ll walk through everything step-by-step in a clear and structured way, leaving out as little as possible. The goal is to let you follow along and recreate what I did — one-to-one — without needing to guess or fill in missing steps.

## 4. Review and Reflection

By this point, most tutorials or thoughts I share will be close to complete. I’ll reflect on the process and highlight potential pitfalls. Since I tend to run into a *lot* of problems myself, chances are I’ll have encountered some of the same issues you might, and hopefully that helps save you time. I’ll also mark in Part 3 where a review section is coming so you can expect it.

###### If you’ve made it this far, I hope that means I’ve helped you in some way — and that makes me really happy. It’s my pleasure to be part of your learning journey. I’ll keep refining this pinned post and try to make it as close to perfect as I can. If you spot any mistakes, please feel free to point them out. I’ll be opening up a comment section soon. Until then, you can reach me on Telegram @xingxi94. Thanks so much for your support and understanding!
